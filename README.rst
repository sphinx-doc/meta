This repository serves to store resources about the Sphinx project at large,
especially those that do not belong in the ``sphinx`` project repository.


Surveys
=======

The ``surveys/`` directory contains a draft 'Sphinx community survey',
as `proposed by Quansight Labs`_.
It requires the use of a tool to convert the survey from YAML
to the relevant survey platform, which is developed in the
`typeform-yaml-survey`_ repository.
