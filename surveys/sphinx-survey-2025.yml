  type: statement
  description: >-
    We’re running this survey to understand requirements for documentation
    tools in 2025, how they are used, and how well tools support their users.
    This survey is being run on behalf of the [Sphinx] community, but is
    open to anyone who works with or contributes to documentation, regardless
    of whether you use Sphinx.

    We will use this information to aid community discussion about improvements
    to Sphinx. Results will be public, with any identifying information removed.
    Open text field questions may be quoted, but will not be shown in full.

    This survey is run by the Sphinx community and [Quansight Labs]; survey
    data will be deleted from any private accounts once made public. If you
    have any questions, contact Tania Allard (Director of Quansight Labs)
    at tallard@quansight.com and mention Sphinx Survey 2025 in the subject line.
