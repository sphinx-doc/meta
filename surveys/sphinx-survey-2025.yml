      Sphinx Documentation User Survey 2025

      Help the Sphinx community understand who is using Sphinx, how they are
      using it, and how well it supports the people using it. We will use this
      information to aid community discussion about improvements to Sphinx.

      Results will be public with identifying information removed. Open text
      field questions may be quoted, but will not be shown in full.

      This survey is run by the Sphinx community; survey data will be deleted
      from any private accounts once made public. If you have any questions,
      reach out to [Contact to be determined].
