# Objective: Gain basic insight about about Sphinx in the wild; who is using it, for what, with what, and with what priorities?
# The goal is to augment discussions on features and issues with feedback that can be followed up on. The survey will not provide prescriptive solutions.

# Target audience: People who interact with documentation, especially those who contribute to or extend documentation. Use of Sphinx is encouraged but not required.

      Sphinx Documentation User Survey 2025

      Help the Sphinx community understand who is using Sphinx, how they are
      using it, and how well it supports the people using it. We will use this
      information to aid community discussion about improvements to Sphinx.

      Results will be public with identifying information removed. Open text
      field questions may be quoted, but will not be shown in full.

      This survey is run by the Sphinx community; survey data will be deleted
      from any private accounts once made public. If you have any questions,
      reach out to [Contact to be determined].
